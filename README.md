# Readability
A program that prints out reading grade, based upon an input portion of text.

### Criterion
+ In a file called readability.c, you’ll implement a program that calculates the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text. Your program should print as output “Grade X” where “X” is the grade level computed, rounded to the nearest integer. If the grade level is 16 or higher (equivalent to or greater than a senior undergraduate reading level), your program should output “Grade 16+” instead of giving the exact index number. If the grade level is less than 1, your program should output “Before Grade 1”.
+ Use the Coleman-Liau index to produce the correct grade.

### Additional info

This program uses a cs50.h header file, available [here](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/libraries/cs50/c/).
